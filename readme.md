Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently a FE intern at Sharpness, having graduated recently from Medieinstitutet in may 2023. I am setting up the end-to-end tests with Cypress and creating GitHub Actions workflows.

I'm actively seeking a full-time position as a FE or fullstack developer, where I can continue to learn and work with my passion.

Please check out my latest project at https://krukan2-0.vercel.app/ ! Still in progress but is now used for as my football team's scheduling and RSVP'ing app.

👷 Currently working on: Improving my portfolio and Krukan 2.0, and a project for Baemingo.

📚 Trying to learn: Cypress and Angular
