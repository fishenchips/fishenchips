Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently a FE intern at Stryda, and graduating from Medieinstitutet in may 2023. Over my intern I have improved greatly in React, Typescript, and in packages such as tanstack query, react hook form. Furthermore I have lead daily stand-ups and retros which I enjoy.

I'm actively seeking a full-time position as a FE developer, where I can continue to learn and work with my passion.

Please check out my latest project at https://krukan2-0.vercel.app/ ! Still in progress but is now used for as my football team's scheduling and RSVP'ing app.

Currently working on: Creating my portfolio and Krukan 2.0.
